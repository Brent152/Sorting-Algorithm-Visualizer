# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Author: Brent Julius
Completion Date: 1/25/2022

Info:
I created this project as a tool for myself to better master/learn sorting algorithms.
This was practically my first time using HTML and CSS, and my first time ever utilizing
JavaScript and React. Throughout its development I learned a LOT about JavaScript, HTML,
CSS, and a moderate amount of React. Please read the disclaimer!

Instructions for use:
To run you must have NodeJS installed - Created using v16.13.1
cd into the sorting_visualizer folder - cd sorting_visualizer
if you haven't used react before you will probably need to do - npm install
run npm start in console and it will open in default browser - npm start

DISCLAIMER:
--------------------- I KNOW I DID NOT USE REACT PROPERLY --------------------- 
MY CODE IS NOT ORGANIZED INTO CLASSES WELL BECAUSE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW PASSING
REACT PROPS WORKED. THIS DISORGANIZATION IS NOT HOW I NORMALLY CODE. REACT WAS SIMPLY
A TOOL I NEEDED TO RUN THE VISUALIZATIONS OF THE ALGORITHMS. THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT
WAS TO BETTER MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE ALGORITHMS, NOT LEARN REACT - SO I DID NOT PUT
MUCH TIME INTO MASTERING IT. BASICALLY DO NOT JUDGE/CRITISIZE HOW WEIRDLY ORGANIZED
THIS PROJECT IS - I KNOW AND I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS.
