# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Author: Brent Julius
Completion Date: 1/25/2022

I created this project as a tool for myself to better master/learn sorting algorithms.
This was practically my first time using HTML and CSS, and my first ever time utilizing
JavaScript and React. Throughout its development I learned a LOT about JavaScript, HTML,
CSS, and a moderate amount of React. Please read the disclaimer!

DISCLAIMER:
--------------------- I KNOW I DID NOT USE REACT PROPERLY --------------------- 
MY CODE IS NOT ORGANIZED INTO CLASSES WELL BECAUSE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW PASSING
REACT PROPS WORKED. THIS DISORGANIZATION IS NOT HOW I NORMALLY CODE. REACT WAS SIMPLY
A TOOL I NEEDED TO RUN THE VISUALIZATIONS OF THE ALGORITHMS. THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT
WAS TO BETTER MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE ALGORITHMS, NOT LEARN REACT - SO I DID NOT PUT
MUCH TIME INTO MASTERING IT. BASICALLY DO NOT JUDGE/CRITISIZE HOW WEIRDLY ORGANIZED
THIS PROJECT IS - I KNOW AND I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS.
